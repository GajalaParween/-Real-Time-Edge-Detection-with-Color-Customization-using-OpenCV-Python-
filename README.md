# -Real-Time-Edge-Detection-with-Color-Customization-using-OpenCV-Python-
Today I built a fun and interactive computer vision project — a real-time edge detection app using my webcam 🎥.

This project utilizes Canny edge detection, Gaussian blur, and trackbars that allow you to adjust thresholds and even change edge colors in real-time. 🎨
🔹 Tech Stack:
Python 🐍
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
🔹 Features:
 ✅ Real-time webcam edge detection
 ✅ Adjustable min/max thresholds with trackbars
 ✅ Dynamic Gaussian blur control
 ✅ Customizable edge color (RGB sliders)
 ✅ Simple, interactive, and visually engaging!
This small project helped me understand how image gradients, blurring, and edge detection work in OpenCV — and how we can create interactive vision tools using Python.

📸 It’s exciting to see how a few lines of code can turn your webcam into a mini vision lab.
